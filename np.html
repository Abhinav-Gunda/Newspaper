                    <h1>Facebook seeks the user feedback to improve content ranking on News Feed</h1>
                    <p>Facebook said Thursday it would emphasize user feedback when prioritizing posts on the leading social network, the latest
                        move to quell concerns over its algorithms. The California giant said it would add weight to surveys asking users if certain
                        messages are "worth your time" as part of its ranking process for its main news feeds. "Our algorithm uses thousands of signals
                        to rank posts for your News Feed with this goal in mind," said a blog post from Aastha Gupta, Facebook product management director.
                    </p>

                    <p>"This spring, we're expanding on our work to use direct feedback from people who use Facebook to understand the content people find
                        most valuable. And we'll continue to incorporate this feedback into our News Feed ranking process".The move comes with Facebook and 
                        other online platforms under pressure over opaque algorithms.

                    <p>
                        CANBERRA: Tech giant Google on Friday launched a platform in Australia offering news it has paid for, striking its own 
                        content deals with publishers in a drive to show legislation proposed by Canberra to enforce payments, a world first, is unnecessary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Only rolled out previously in Brazil and Germany, the News Showcase platform was originally slated for launch last June.
                        But Alphabet Inc-owned Google delayed plans when Canberra moved to make it a legal requirement for Google and Facebook to 
                        pay Australian media companies for content, unprecedented anywhere else in the world.
                        The tech firm, still lobbying the Australian government in private meetings, has previously said was the legislation was 
                        "unworkable" and would force it to pull.

                        The move has elicited criticism from experts who have questioned whether digital news can be regulated under the IT Act.
                        News portals and websites will be expected to follow the same norms that traditional media publishers, such as newspapers and news channels, adhere to.

                        External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday held wide-ranging talks with his Saudi counterpart Faisal Bin Farhan Al Saud covering a range of 
                        bilateral and regional issues including developments in Afghanistan. Al Saud arrived here on Saturday evening on a three-day visit.

                        "Delighted to welcome FM of Saudi Arabia HH Prince @Faisalbinfarhan for his first ever visit to India," Jaishankar tweeted.
                        The Saudi foreign minister is scheduled to call on Prime Minister Narendra Modi

                        The visit by the Saudi foreign minister comes at a time when India has been engaged with all leading powers on the developments in Afghanistan 
                        following its takeover by the Taliban.
                        It is learnt that the situation in Afghanistan was a major area of focus of the talks between Jaishankar and Al Saud.
